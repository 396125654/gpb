Version ToBeFilledIn
ToBeFilledIn

	* Bugfix compilation of several files (only the first file
	was actually compiled, even if several files were specified)
	* Add possibility to generate and encode a descriptor, which is a
	self-describing byte-blob according to descriptor.proto.
	* Add possibility to make the generated code compile-time
	independent of gpb by generating the introspection information to
	proplists instead of to #field{} records. The latter required
	including gpb.hrl at compiletime. (There's no run-time dependency)
	* Add possibility to prefix message/record and names and module
	names to avoid name collisions.
	* Add -type to the commad line options, thanks to Louis-Philippe
	Gauthier. Previously it existed only as an Erlang API option.

Version 3.0
2013-08-24
	* Improve decoding performance by roughly 8--19%
	* Completely rewrite the code generator. Use a parse-transform
	  instead of formatting and assembling strings.
	* Minor improvement in the generated code for version_as_list.

Version 2.3
2013-08-18
	* Fix Rebar compile on non-GNU systems, such as Mac OS X, thanks
	to Everton Ribeiro
	* Bugfix (mostly) rare compilation breakage: depending on the
	date/time of generation, a new-line was inserted, causing a
	compilation error.
	* Ignore non-version-like tags

Version 2.2
2013-07-13

	* Wrap generated skip-functions with quotes. Thanks to jesse-ad.
	* Experimental support for calling protoc code via a NIF
	* Empty lists are now default values for repeated fields. Thanks
	to Martin Donath.
	* New option, use_packages for prepending the package name found
	in the proto file, to the message names. Thanks to Martin Donath.
	* New option: strings_as_binaries (-strbin), for returning strings
	as binaries. Thanks to Lars Thorsen for suggesting this option.
	* New option: {o_erl,Dir} (-o-erl Dir), {o_hrl,Dir} (-o-hrl Dir)
	and {o_nif_cc,Dir} (-o-nif-cc Dir) to specify destination
	directory by file type. Thanks to Patrik Sandahl for suggesting
	those options.
	* New option: include_as_lib (-il) to include gpb.hrl as a
	library. This makes it easier to integrate with rebar. Thanks to
	Martin Donath.
	* Generate introspection functions for enum conversions:
	M:enum_symbol_by_value/2, M:enum_value_by_symbol/2,
	M:enum_symbol_by_value_<Enum>/1, M:enum_value_by_symbol_<Enum>/1;
	thanks to Patrik Sandahl for suggesting those functions.
	* Bugfix name resolution. Thanks to Heiner Bunjes for reporting
	the bug. This prompted a major rewrite of the name resolution code
	that was originally a quick patch-work, and not in very good shape.
	* Handle C-style comments. Thanks to Patrik Sandahl for reporting
	this bug.
	* Add a section to the README.md showing rebar integration, thanks
	to Bin Wang for asking the question that prompted me to write it
	up.
	* Bugfix command line option parsing using the -extra alternative.
	* Benchmark code improvements.
	* Build: version number: defined format and enforced/verified
	consistency between gpb_version.hrl and src/gpb.app.src: using the
	git tag as the source of information.
